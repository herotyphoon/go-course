# Bitwise Logical Operators

- Bits are samllest unit of computer memory and the language of computers.
- The bitwise operators are used to perform low-level bit manipulation operators

## Bitwise OR Operator

| A   | B   | OR (\|) |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0       |
| 0   | 1   | 1       |
| 1   | 0   | 1       |
| 1   | 1   | 1       |

- Sets resultant bit if either bit is set

## Bitwise AND Operator

| A   | B   | AND (&) |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0       |
| 0   | 1   | 0       |
| 1   | 0   | 0       |
| 1   | 1   | 1       |

- Sets resultant bit if both bits are set

## Bitwise XOR Operator

| A   | B   | XOR (^) |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0       |
| 0   | 1   | 1       |
| 1   | 0   | 1       |
| 1   | 1   | 0       |

- Sets resultant bit if one bit is set and other is not

## Bitwise AND NOT Operator

| A   | B   | AND NOT (&^) |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0            |
| 0   | 1   | 0            |
| 1   | 0   | 1            |
| 1   | 1   | 0            |

- Sets resultant bit if bit is set in the first number and not the second number

## Bitwise INVERT Operator

| A   | INVERT (^) |
| --- | ---------- |
| 0   | 1          |
| 1   | 0          |

- Inverts the bits
